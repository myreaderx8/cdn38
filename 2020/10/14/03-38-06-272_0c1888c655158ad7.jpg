would see students carrying stacks of books as they walk to their next class. In today’s modern times, students do not need to lug around as many textbooks and notes as before. Instead, they read their day’s lessons from the PDF files on their phones or laptops. Additionally, they may be using [PDF tools](https://pdfbear.com/pdf-converter \"PDF tools\") to make their life a little bit easier during their educational journey. \n\nWhat’s more, with the COVID-19 pandemic threatening to stay indefinitely, learning as we know it has drastically changed. Classroom learning is now giving way to online learning, where digital files such as PDFs are crucial in exchanging information accurately and quickly. \n\nFrom displaying a whole textbook to showing graphs, PDF files can do a lot to make learning easier. That is why it is important for educators to familiarize themselves with these tools to help make teaching and learning more effective. \n\nFor first-time PDF users, there are many helpful platforms on the Internet that can help you use the PDF efficiently. One of which is PDFBear. \n\nThis guide will teach you how to use the PDF and how PDFBear can help you manage your files effectively.\n\n## What is a PDF?\nThe term PDF means “Portable Document Format”. These are read-only files that are used to present documents. These files are in a print-ready format and they support various elements like graphs, charts, and images while retaining the layout of a page.\n\nPDF files are commonly used for e-books, application forms, and bank statements among others. To add, these files can be opened on any device no matter the operating system. All you need is a PDF reader.\n\n## The Importance of PDF in Learning and Education\nAs the years go by, more and more professors are switching from hardcover textbooks to more portable e-books and PDF manuals. Pandemic aside, here are a few reasons why PDF files have a big role to play when it comes to learning and education.\n\n### 1. PDF files are portable.\nPDF files give students the convenience to carry more digital textbooks anywhere they go. As these files take up small amounts of storage, a person can carry hundreds of books and learning materials in their pockets. This makes it easy for them to review their notes even when they’re on the train.\n\n### 2. It is easier to find information in PDF files.\nPDF files help students become more productive by giving them an easier time to find information. Those 10 to 15 minutes of searching the library for a book can turn into just a few seconds of typing. Just type ctrl + f and they’ll be able to find the information they’re looking for.\n\n### 3.

This makes it very convenient and accessible for the students, thus making it much easier to learn. PDF files are also easy to convert from one file format to another. Using a reliable PDF converter, you can have your chosen file format in seconds!\n\n### 4. PDF files preserve documents.\nIt is so unfortunate when we lose important documents and scientific notes due to unfortunate circumstances. For instance, when books get destroyed by mites or fire. You will not only lose data but also time as you have to do the experiment again.\n\nLuckily, digitizing those books by uploading them as PDF files can prevent these dangers and even preserve the documents for long periods of time. No matter how long you’ll be using your files, you wouldn’t have to worry about faded or ripped pages as long as your PDF files are uploaded in the cloud.\n\n## Benefits of Using the PDF\nMany people might ask: “Why do we have to learn how to use PDF files? If there are a lot of other file types, what makes this so special?” One simple answer to that question is because it makes our lives easier. It is one of the most common and versatile digital formats around and more often than not, we will encounter PDF files in our professional lives. \n\nTo expound on that, here are a few reasons why it is important to know the nooks and crannies of the PDF.\n \n### 1.

PDF files are compact.\nIt is a given that digital files are easier to carry around than their physical counterparts. Apart from being compact in the literal sense, PDF files are also compressed into a small file size. Indeed, this makes them very convenient as they take up less space on your hard drive.

PDF is the most common digital format used everywhere.\nYou might be thinking if it’s worth it to spend all those time learning about PDF files, or if you’re going to use it that much. Don’t ask “when do we use it?” Because the real question to ask is this — “when do we not use PDF?” In fact, there are times when you might not even realize that you’ve been using a PDF file all the while! Like it or not, these types of files are a staple in our everyday lives. Indeed, sooner or later, there will be an instance when you have to learn how to use one or modify one.

This is often seen as an advantage. However, there are some instances when it can be a problem. One example is when somebody accidentally sends you a copy with a typographical error and you have to edit it.\n \nOne workaround to this problem is that you can convert PDF to Word in just a few clicks.

One such event is when you have to do a presentation. Yes, PDF files are great. However, they have their own set of limitations. Meanwhile, Powerpoint files can provide notes, animation effects, and custom shows.\n \nThere may not be too many websites that can convert a [PDF to a Powerpoint file](https://pdfbear.com/pdf-to-ppt \"PDF to a Powerpoint file\").

The converted Powerpoint file will be in its original format and can be edited.\n \n### 4. Learn how to rotate your PDF file\nWhile a lot of files are typically read in a portrait orientation, there are a few exceptions when a landscape format is preferable. For instance, when you’re trying to display a map, a graph, or an image. Believe me when I say that your reading experience can improve a lot just by changing the orientation. With that said, it is important to learn [how to rotate a PDF](https://pdfbear.com/rotate-pdf \"how to rotate a PDF\") file.\n \nAnother feature of PDFBear that you will surely find useful is its ability to rotate your files.

Learn how to combine two PDF files in one by merging them\nA lot of people say that two is better than one. But that’s not always the case. One example is when you need to read two or more PDF files at the same time. Imagine studying a topic and constantly switching between six files. It could take a lot of time to sort through all those files.\n \nHere’s a productivity hack for you — you can merge PDF files into a single document. Apart from making your files more orderly, it also saves you the trouble of tracking the files down one by one in case you need to send or print them. And due to the number of available [PDF combiner tools](https://pdfbear.com/merge-pdf \"PDF combiner tools\") that you can find online, you don’t have to break a sweat by doing so!\n \nIn the case of PDFBear, all you have to do is to drag and drop all the files you want to merge into their [PDF merger](https://pdfbear.com/merge-pdf \"PDF merger\").

What this means is that you wouldn’t have to use any capacity on your computer when merging PDF files. This, in turn, saves you resources.\n \n### 6. Learn how to split and extract a PDF file\nOur productivity hack doesn’t end with the previous item. If you can combine multiple PDF files into a single document, then surely you can do the opposite. In other words, you can also split a PDF file into individual pages. This is particularly useful when only a single page out of a thousand is relevant to your work. Indeed, it can be frustrating to have to keep a thousand-page document when all you need is a single line.\n \nWith that said, PDFBear’s Split PDF function will let you separate or [extract pages in your PDF](https://pdfbear.com/split-pdf \"extract pages in your PDF\") individually and turn them into new PDF files. Apart from that, it lets you do it with ease. Just drag and drop the PDF file that you would like to split and wait for it to upload. Once done uploading, the window will show you the pages included in the file.\n \nYou can then choose which parts you want to split from the whole file. After selecting the pages that you want, click the button to refine them and export it into a single PDF file. Lastly, you can download or share your split file with your colleagues or friends.\n \nPDFBear’s Split Function has two features. For one, you can choose to split your PDF into individual pages. Alternatively, you have the option to just extract specific pages from the original document. Either way, these features are easy to use and operate.\n \n### 7. Learn how to send PDF files to your students in one click\nThe best thing about the PDF is that it is possible to [share your PDF](https://pdfbear.com/share-document \"share your PDF\") with multiple people at once. File sharing is made easier through the PDFBear website. PDFBear’s Share Document tool is very convenient especially when you’re planning to send it to a lot of people or when you want to save time.\n \nTo do so, all you have to do is upload the file that you want to share. The window will then ask for a list of the recipients’ email addresses. In addition, you can fill in the space of the text box and write an optional message in case you have some instructions. Once you’re confident with the message and file, you can send it in two ways. One is you can send it directly via their email addresses. The second option is you can just send out the link that will redirect them to your file.\n \nLastly, you don’t have to worry about compromising security when using this tool. To demonstrate, PDFBear uses a 256 bit AES encryption. This ensures that your privacy is guaranteed. Apart from that, the tool maintains the document’s original quality unlike what happens in other tools.\n \n### 8. Learn how to add watermarks to your PDF files to protect them\nI am sure that you’ve read some horror stories where people steal photos and pass it off as their own. This is particularly prevalent in the photography and graphic design community. Unfortunately, it can also happen to your PDF files. To prevent someone from stealing your work and claiming it as their own, I suggest that you [add watermark to PDF](https://pdfbear.com/add-watermark-pdf \"add watermark to PDF\") files. In fact, this is the most common workaround to that problem.\n \nWhat makes PDFBear’s Add Watermark tool is that you can stamp a variety of watermarks to your file. You can either use an image or a text. Apart from that, you can even customize the transparency and the position of it. They even have a wide range of font styles from color, style, and font family that you can choose from. It is definitely a bonus to be able to create an attractive watermark for your file.\n \nNow, the steps to applying watermarks are simple. Drag and drop your desired file into the window and wait for it to upload. Next, you have to type a text or select the image that you want to put as a watermark. After that, do the necessary modifications and select a good position where you want to put it. When you’re done, you can download the PDF file with the watermark in it.\n \nPDFBear uses watermarks with cloud technology. What this means is that it lets you save your documents and files without using any of your client-side. This allows you to save on storage and processing time on your device.\n \n### 9. Learn how to protect your PDF file by adding a password\nWhen it comes to security, you would be delighted to know that there are a few more options for you to consider. If adding a watermark is not enough, you can add your own password to your PDF file. Yes, you read that right. You can prevent people from reading your file even if they get a copy of it.\n \nIf you want to keep the contents of your PDF file confidential, simply use PDFBear’s Protect PDF function. For this to work, you have to upload your chosen file and upload it. The window will then ask you for a password. Make sure to remember this before clicking \"Encrypt PDF\"! Once done, you can now download your encrypted file.\n \nSpeaking of passwords, there are a few things that you have to consider. Avoid using common ones that are easy to guess like “1234” or “asdfghjkl”. In fact, the recommended length of a strong password is at least 9 characters. That includes both alphabets and numerals, and a mix of capital letters and special characters. For example, using “p@s$w0rd123” is much better than “password” and has fewer chances of being guessed.\n \nTo put your mind more at ease, PDFBear uses a secure SSL connection. And once they have produced the encrypted PDF file for you, they will set up another SSL encrypted connection for maximum security. Indeed, it says a lot about how they value their clients’ privacy and security.\n \n### 10. Learn how to add page numbers to your PDF files\nWhen going through a long piece of work, it is important to know every now and then which page you are on. Apart from keeping track of your progress, it also makes it easier for you to go back to it. Another instance when [adding page numbers to your PDF](https://pdfbear.com/add-page-numbers-to-pdf \"adding page numbers to your PDF\") file, you want someone to read a specific part of the file; simply put, finding specific sections of a file is easier when there are page numbers.\n \nFortunately for you, there are a few online tools that let you add pages to PDF. To use PDFBear’s Number Pages function, you have to select and upload the file that you want to modify. Once it’s successfully uploaded, you can choose the position where you want the page numbers to appear. Once you have decided on a location, you just have to click the “number pages” button and PDFBear will handle the rest.\n \nIf you’re very particular with the design of your documents, you’ll be delighted to hear that you can choose the design of your page numbers. PDFBear’s editor lets you customize the typography of the number. Apart from that, you can also assign the first page as a cover page so the tool won’t put a page number on the cover.\n \nAll of these actions are performed in the cloud. Thus, you do not have to download or learn how to use any software when using this tool.\n \n## PDF is the Present and the Future of Digital Learning\nIt must be clear by now that the PDF is one thing that won’t go away for a while. Even though technology is volatile and changes easily, this one has survived the test of times and has proven that it does not grow obsolete so fast. In fact, a lot of people think that the PDF file is here for the long haul. In fact, in 10 years’ time, the PDF file will probably still be standing strong and will still be relevant.\n \nEver since its invention in the early 1990s, the PDF file has shown that it is the most common file type to share and use. Like what I said before, this file format can be used and presented on any operating system. Whether it is a PC, a Mac, or a smartphone running on Android, you don’t have to worry about not being able to view it.
